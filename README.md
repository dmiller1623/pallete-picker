# Pallete Picker

Palette Picker is a site that allows the user to generate 5 new random colors to create a pallete that looks good. As a user you are able to lock certain colors and radmoize the rest also be able to save those projects and palletes to the backend.

## The Why 

This was my first project creating my own backend in order to interact with the front end. The goal was to get familiar with Node.js and have a better understanding of how the backend works.
